# Summit Discord Bot
Flynn is playing around making a bot for Discord with Python, because why not?

Testing bot functionality in my testing server:
https://discord.gg/BrUKp5YH

# Commands
Note: The command prefix is !

## mute
### Arguments: None
Mutes the bot indefinitely. Reactions will still be added to trigger messages, but the bot will not respond.

## muteuntil
### Arguments: Minutes to mute for
Mutes the bot for a set number of minutes. Reactions will still be added to trigger messages while muted.

## ismuted
### Arguments: None
Checks if the bot is muted, and if so, tell when the bot will wake back up (if at all)

## wake
### Arguments: None
Wakes the bot from mute. Doesn't care if the bot is actually muted or not.

## greeting
### Arguments: None

## goodbye
### Arguments: None
These are still in here?
